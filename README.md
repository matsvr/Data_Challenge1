## Goal:  
The goal here was to develop a solution for multi-class document classification using embeddings generated by BERT. We were asked to ensure both accuracy and fairness in predicting labels across 28 categories while addressing sensitive attributes such as gender. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and implementation of machine learning models to mitigate bias and improve classification performance.
